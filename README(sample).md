## Functionality

The user types a city name in the search box and is lead to 5 days weather forecast of the city. It shows the forecast of wind in MPH, temperature in farenheit, humidity in % and weather icon. On the right side the user is shown in a large box day 1 forecast so that user can see what his day looks like. Rest from there 5 days forecast if shown below. As the user types the city, it is saved below the search button so that it can be easily accessiable. When user refreshes the application all the search city are gone, so that he can enter new citites.

## Code

The application uses local storage to store persistent data. The cities that a user search is saved in a local storage. It also uses third party API, openweathermap.org which shows the weather details. This project uses semantic html, CSS, and JavaScript.
