    ## Functionality
    
    The user types a city name in the search box and is lead to 5 days weather forecast of the city. It shows the forecast of wind in MPH, temperature in farenheit, humidity in % and weather icon. On the right side the user is shown in a large box day 1 forecast so that user can see what his day looks like. Rest from there 5 days forecast if shown below.

    The application uses local storage to store persistent data. The cities that a user search is saved in a local storage. It also uses third party API, openweathermap.org which shows the weather details. This project uses semantic html, CSS, and JavaScript.
