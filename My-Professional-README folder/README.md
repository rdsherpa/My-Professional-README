# PROJECT TITLE:

    My-Weather-Application

    # Overview
    The repository shows a weather application that displays 5 days weather forecast of any city the user types.

    ## Description

Main motivation behind was to challange my self with Java Script. I feel like I need to work more on Java Script as there is lots of logic involve and this challenge would help me understand how Java Script actually works.

I wanted to build this project so that people can easily access 5 days weather forecast when they search for any city in US. I also wanted to explore more about how Java Script works and the ways it can grab elements from HTML AND CSS.

People can easily access 5 days weather of any US city and this also helps me to improve my skills.

I learned more about making a code clean, styling and doing more research for CSS and Java Script. Patient is the key is what I learned from this challenge. Give your best to try solving this problem and if doubts as your tutor and get feedback. Never hesitate to ask for help.

I also learned how to use third party APIs and how to fetch them in JavaScript. I had a better understanding of JavaScript through this project. Although this project took me 3 weeks to finish, but knowledge that I gained was immense.

    ## Functionality

    The user types a city name in the search box and is lead to 5 days weather forecast of the city. It shows the forecast of wind in MPH, temperature in farenheit, humidity in % and weather icon. On the right side the user is shown in a large box day 1 forecast so that user can see what his day looks like. Rest from there 5 days forecast if shown below. As the user types the city, it is saved below the search button so that it can be easily accessiable. When user refreshes the application all the search city are gone, so that he can enter new citites.


    ## Code

    The application uses local storage to store persistent data. The cities that a user search is saved in a local storage. It also uses third party API, openweathermap.org which shows the weather details. This project uses semantic html, CSS, and JavaScript.

    ## Comments

    I have included notes on on JavaScript to make it more clear where the code is being applied to and what each code does.
